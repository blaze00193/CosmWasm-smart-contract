# Sylvia Framework

Sylvia is the old name meaning Spirit of The Wood.

Sylvia is Roman godness of the forrest.

Sylvia is also a framework created to give you the abstraction
focused and scallable solution for building your CosmWasm Smart Contracts.
Find your way into the forrest of Cosmos ecosystem. We provide you toolset,
so insteadd of focusing on raw structure of your contract, you can just
create them in proper and idiomatic Rust, and then just let cargo make sure,
that there are sound.

## The approach

CosmWasm ecosystem core provides the base building blocks for builing SmartContracts -
the `cosmwasm-std` for basic CW bindings, the `cw-storage-plus` for easier state
manangement, and the `cw-multitest`for testing them. Sylvia framework is build on top
of them, so creating contracts you don't need to think about messages structure,
how their API is (de)serialized, or how to handle messages dispatching.

Instead of that, the API of your contract is set of traits, you implement on you
SC type. Things like entry point structures, functions dispatching the messages, or
even helpers for multitest are generated by the framework. It allows for better control
of interfaces, including validating their completeness in compile time. Also as a side
effect, as Sylvia has all the knowledge about the contract API structure, it can
generate whole bunch of helpers - utilities for multitests, or even queriers.

## The state

Right now Sylvia is ready to implement simple smart contracts. `Insantiation`, `Execution`, and
`Query` messages can be implemented easily. `migrate`, `sudo` and `reply` messages are missing
right now, but all of those can be covered by simply implementing their entry points and
dispatching manually, so for basic functionality Sylvia also can be used. Sylvia already
supports oveerriding the chain custom messages, so it is possible to use it with custom blokchains -
except for handling custom queries and sudo messages. All messages can be generic, so it is even
possible to create contract eligible to work across several different CosmWasm blockchains.

For now only messages dispatching is generated - queriers utilties and MT helpers are on the
TODO list, so expect them soon.
